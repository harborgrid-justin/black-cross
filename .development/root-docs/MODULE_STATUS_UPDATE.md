## Implementation Gap

### Basic CRUD vs Production Ready

**Basic Module** (37 lines):
```typescript
class Service {
  async create(data: any) { /* Simple insert */ }
  async getById(id: string) { /* Basic query */ }
  async list(filters = {}) { /* Basic list */ }
  async update(id, updates) { /* Basic update */ }
  async delete(id) { /* Basic delete */ }
}
```

**Production Module** (600+ lines):
```typescript
class Service {
  // Feature 1: Advanced Operations (10-15 methods)
  // Feature 2: Validation & Processing (5-10 methods)
  // Feature 3: Integration & Enrichment (5-10 methods)
  // Feature 4: Workflow & Automation (5-10 methods)
  // Feature 5: Analysis & Reporting (5-10 methods)
  // Feature 6: Bulk Operations (3-5 methods)
  // Feature 7: Advanced Search (3-5 methods)
  // + Helper methods and utilities
}
```

**Gap**: ~570 lines per module × 9 modules = ~5,100 lines needed
