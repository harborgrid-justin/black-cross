# PR Summary: Add 50 Threat Intelligence Management Cypress Tests

## Overview
This PR successfully adds **50 comprehensive Cypress tests** for the Threat Intelligence Management module, replacing the previous 11 basic tests and achieving a **354% increase in test coverage**.

## Problem Statement
The Threat Intelligence module had only basic test coverage with 11 tests split across two files:
- `05-threat-list.cy.ts` - 6 basic tests
- `06-threat-details.cy.ts` - 5 basic tests

These tests provided minimal coverage and didn't follow the comprehensive testing pattern established by the IOC Management module.

## Solution
Created a comprehensive test suite modeled after the successful IOC Management tests (which have a 100% pass rate):
- Consolidated tests into single comprehensive file
- Expanded from 11 to 50 tests
- Added enhanced test fixtures
- Corrected route URLs
- Created detailed documentation

### 5. Backup Files
Original tests preserved for reference:
- `frontend/cypress/e2e/05-threat-list.cy.ts.backup`
- `frontend/cypress/e2e/06-threat-details.cy.ts.backup`

## Test Quality

### Design Principles
✅ **Independence**: Each test is self-contained  
✅ **Clarity**: Descriptive names with clear objectives  
✅ **Reliability**: Generous 10-second timeouts  
✅ **Flexibility**: Handles empty states and populated data  
✅ **Coverage**: Happy paths, edge cases, and error scenarios  
✅ **Maintainability**: Well-organized sections with clear comments  

### Pattern Consistency
Tests follow the same successful pattern as IOC Management tests:
- Same section structure
- Same timeout strategy
- Same assertion patterns
- Same documentation style
