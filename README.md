## üîß Installation

### Quick Setup (5 Minutes)

The fastest way to get started with Black-Cross:

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/harborgrid-justin/black-cross.git
cd black-cross

# 2. Run automated setup
npm run setup

# 3. Start PostgreSQL (using Docker)
docker-compose up -d postgres

# 4. Sync database models
npm run db:sync

# 5. Start the application
npm run dev

# Access the application:
# Frontend: http://localhost:3000
# Backend API: http://localhost:8080
# Default login: admin@black-cross.io / admin
```

**‚úÖ That's it!** See [SETUP.md](./SETUP.md) for detailed instructions and troubleshooting.

### Alternative: Docker Compose (All Services)

To run with all services (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis, Elasticsearch):

```bash
# Clone and start all services
git clone https://github.com/harborgrid-justin/black-cross.git
cd black-cross
docker-compose up -d

# Access the application
# Frontend: http://localhost:3000
# Backend API: http://localhost:8080
```

### Manual Setup

For manual installation without the automated setup script:

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install
cd backend && npm install
cd ../frontend && npm install

# Setup environment files
cp backend/.env.example backend/.env
cp frontend/.env.example frontend/.env

# Sync database models with Sequelize
npm run db:sync

# Start development servers
npm run dev
```

### Production Build

```bash
# Build frontend
cd frontend
npm run build

# Start backend
cd ../backend
npm start
```
