## Test Coverage

The test suite comprehensively covers:

1. **UI Components**: All major UI elements including buttons, inputs, dialogs, cards, chips, tables, and forms
2. **User Interactions**: Clicking, typing, dialog opening/closing, hypothesis selection
3. **Responsive Design**: Mobile (iPhone X) and tablet (iPad 2) viewports
4. **Data Display**: Statistics, hypotheses, findings, query results
5. **CRUD Operations**: Creating hypotheses, saving queries, managing findings
6. **Performance**: Page load times, rapid navigation, state management
7. **Edge Cases**: Empty states, multiple items, window resizing

## Test Patterns

Following the established patterns from:
- `05-threat-intelligence.cy.ts` (50 tests)
- `12-ioc-management.cy.ts` (50 tests)

The test suite uses:
- Descriptive test names with numbered prefixes
- Organized sections with clear comments
- Proper timeouts and waits
- MUI component selectors
- Flexible text matching where appropriate
- Assertion chains for complex verifications

## Running the Tests

```bash
# From the frontend directory
cd frontend

# Run all threat hunting tests
npm run cypress -- --spec "cypress/e2e/19-threat-hunting.cy.ts"

# Run in headless mode
npm run test:e2e -- --spec "cypress/e2e/19-threat-hunting.cy.ts"

# Open Cypress GUI
npm run cypress
```

## Prerequisites

- Frontend dev server running on `http://localhost:3000`
- Backend API server running on `http://localhost:8080`
- All dependencies installed (`npm install`)

## Test Quality

The tests are designed to:
- Be reliable and deterministic
- Provide clear failure messages
- Cover both happy paths and edge cases
- Match actual UI implementation
- Be maintainable and readable
- Follow Cypress best practices

## Future Enhancements

Potential areas for test expansion:
- API mocking for isolated frontend testing
- Performance benchmarking
- Accessibility testing with axe-core
- Visual regression testing
- Data-driven testing with fixtures
- E2E workflow testing across multiple pages

## Conclusion

This comprehensive test suite of 100 tests provides robust coverage of the Threat Hunting Platform feature, ensuring all major functionality works as expected and helping prevent regressions in future development.
