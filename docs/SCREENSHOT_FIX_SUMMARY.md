# Screenshot Fix Summary - PR 75 Blank Screenshots

## Problem Identified

Screenshots 29-41 from PR #75 were blank white images (4.2KB each) instead of containing actual page content.

## Root Cause

The screenshots were created as placeholder images that failed to capture actual rendered page content. They were either:
- Captured before page content loaded
- Created with insufficient wait times for rendering
- Generated as placeholders without proper browser automation

## Solution Implemented

1. **Set up full development environment**:
   - PostgreSQL database running in Docker
   - Backend server (Node.js + Express) on port 8080
   - Frontend server (React + Vite) on port 3000
   - All services configured and operational

2. **Created automated screenshot capture script**:
   - Used Playwright browser automation
   - Implemented proper wait times for content loading
   - Added network idle detection
   - Configured for 1280x720 viewport
   - Full-page screenshot capture

3. **Regenerated all 13 blank screenshots**:
   - All screenshots now contain proper rendered content
   - Dark theme with Material-UI components visible
   - Navigation sidebars, headers, and page content rendered
   - Data tables, statistics, and interactive elements captured
