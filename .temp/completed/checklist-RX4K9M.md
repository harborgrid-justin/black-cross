# Redux CRUD Analysis Checklist

## Phase 1: Redux Slice Inventory
- [ ] Read collaborationSlice.ts
- [ ] Read complianceSlice.ts
- [ ] Read feedSlice.ts (threat-feeds)
- [ ] Read huntingSlice.ts (threat-hunting)
- [ ] Read threatSlice.ts (threat-intelligence)
- [ ] Read vulnerabilitySlice.ts (vulnerability-management)
- [ ] Read automationSlice.ts
- [ ] Read darkWebSlice.ts (dark-web)
- [ ] Read incidentSlice.ts (incident-response)
- [ ] Read iocSlice.ts (ioc-management)
- [ ] Read malwareSlice.ts (malware-analysis)
- [ ] Read reportingSlice.ts
- [ ] Read riskSlice.ts (risk-assessment)
- [ ] Read siemSlice.ts
- [ ] Read actorSlice.ts (threat-actors)
- [ ] Create CRUD operation matrix (15 modules x 4 operations)
- [ ] Document state shape for each slice
- [ ] Identify loading/error handling patterns

## Phase 2: CRUD Pattern Analysis
- [ ] Deep-dive threat-intelligence CREATE thunk
- [ ] Deep-dive incident-response CREATE/UPDATE thunks
- [ ] Document working thunk patterns
- [ ] Identify all missing CREATE operations
- [ ] Identify all missing UPDATE operations
- [ ] Identify all missing DELETE operations
- [ ] Compare error handling across slices
- [ ] Document success notification patterns
- [ ] Analyze optimistic vs pessimistic updates

## Phase 3: Non-Redux Module Analysis
- [ ] Scan all pages/ subdirectories for modules
- [ ] Identify modules without Redux slices
- [ ] Analyze Case Management local state
- [ ] Analyze Draft Workspace local state
- [ ] Analyze Metrics local state
- [ ] Analyze Notifications local state
- [ ] Evaluate migration necessity for each
- [ ] Document recommendation with justification

## Phase 4: Architecture Recommendations
- [ ] Write Redux architecture assessment
- [ ] Create standardized CREATE thunk pattern
- [ ] Create standardized READ thunk pattern
- [ ] Create standardized UPDATE thunk pattern
- [ ] Create standardized DELETE thunk pattern
- [ ] Define recommended state shape for entities
- [ ] Define recommended error state shape
- [ ] Define recommended loading state shape
- [ ] Create TypeScript type definitions for patterns
- [ ] Write implementation examples (3-5 examples)
- [ ] Document selector patterns
- [ ] Document best practices guide

## Phase 5: Migration Strategy
- [ ] Prioritize modules by business criticality
- [ ] Create module-by-module migration plan
- [ ] Define testing strategy for new thunks
- [ ] Identify integration points with backend APIs
- [ ] Document risk assessment
- [ ] Create implementation timeline
- [ ] Define success metrics

## Deliverables
- [ ] Complete CRUD operation matrix
- [ ] Architecture assessment report
- [ ] Standardized thunk patterns (TypeScript)
- [ ] Implementation examples
- [ ] Migration strategy document
- [ ] Completion summary
