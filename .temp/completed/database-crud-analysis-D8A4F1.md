# Database CRUD Analysis - Black-Cross Platform

**Generated**: 2025-10-24
**Agent**: Database Architect
**Analysis ID**: D8A4F1

---

## Executive Summary

This analysis examines the complete CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operation coverage across all 26 backend modules in the Black-Cross threat intelligence platform. The system uses a hybrid database architecture with:
- **PostgreSQL (Sequelize ORM)**: 8 core models for structured relational data
- **MongoDB (Mongoose)**: Per-module collections for unstructured/flexible schema data

### Key Findings

1. **Strong CRUD Foundation**: 16/26 modules have complete or near-complete CRUD implementations
2. **Database Coverage Gap**: Only 8 Sequelize models exist for 26 modules requiring data persistence
3. **Hybrid Architecture**: Most modules use MongoDB models (not PostgreSQL) for flexibility
4. **Special Operations**: Archive, soft delete, and audit trail patterns are partially implemented
5. **Validation Strategy**: Comprehensive Joi validation at controller layer, model-level constraints in Sequelize

## 1. Database Models Inventory

### 1.1 PostgreSQL Models (Sequelize - `/backend/models/`)

| Model | Table | Primary Use | Timestamps | Soft Delete | Relationships |
|-------|-------|-------------|------------|-------------|---------------|
| **User** | users | Authentication, RBAC | ✓ | ✓ (isActive) | HasMany: Incident, AuditLog |
| **Incident** | incidents | Security incidents | ✓ | ✗ | BelongsTo: User |
| **Vulnerability** | vulnerabilities | CVE tracking | ✓ | ✗ | None |
| **Asset** | assets | IT inventory | ✓ | ✗ | None |
| **AuditLog** | audit_logs | Audit trail | ✗ | ✗ | BelongsTo: User |
| **IOC** | iocs | Indicators of Compromise | ✓ | ✓ (isActive) | None |
| **ThreatActor** | threat_actors | Threat intelligence | ✓ | ✗ | None |
| **PlaybookExecution** | playbook_executions | Automation history | ✗ | ✗ | None |

**Total PostgreSQL Models**: 8

### 1.2 MongoDB Models (Mongoose - per module)

Each module with MongoDB support maintains its own model in `backend/modules/*/models/`:

| Module | MongoDB Model(s) | Purpose |
|--------|-----------------|---------|
| threat-intelligence | Threat, Taxonomy, ThreatCorrelation | Flexible threat data with nested documents |
| incident-response | Incident, Workflow | Workflow execution state, evidence storage |
| vulnerability-management | Vulnerability | Scan results, CVE enrichment data |
| ioc-management | IoC | IOC feeds with dynamic attributes |
| threat-actors | ThreatActor | Campaign tracking, TTP documentation |
| siem | SiemEvent | High-volume log events |
| threat-hunting | HuntSession | Query history, findings |
| malware-analysis | Malware | Sample metadata, analysis results |
| dark-web | DarkWeb | Monitoring results |
| threat-feeds | ThreatFeed | Feed configurations |
| compliance | ComplianceFramework | Framework definitions |
| collaboration | Collaboration | Team communications |
| reporting | Report | Report definitions |

**Note**: MongoDB is optional; system works without it but loses module-specific data storage.

### 3.2 Key Schema Characteristics

#### PostgreSQL Models (Sequelize)

**Strengths**:
- Strong typing with TypeScript decorators
- Built-in relationship management (HasMany, BelongsTo)
- Database-level constraints (UNIQUE, NOT NULL, foreign keys)
- Indexed fields for query performance
- Automatic timestamp management (createdAt, updatedAt)
- Snake_case column naming (underscored: true)

**Constraints & Validations**:
- User: UNIQUE on email/username, NOT NULL on role, default isActive=true
- Incident: NOT NULL on title/severity/status, indexed on status/severity
- Vulnerability: UNIQUE on cve_id, indexed on severity/status
- IOC: Indexed on type/value/severity, isActive for soft delete
- ThreatActor: UNIQUE on name, indexed

**Soft Delete Implementation**:
- User: `isActive` boolean (default: true)
- IOC: `isActive` boolean (default: true)
- Others: Hard delete (consider adding soft delete)

#### MongoDB Models (Mongoose)

**Strengths**:
- Flexible schema for evolving threat data
- JSONB-like nested document storage
- High write throughput for event streams (SIEM)
- Dynamic field addition without migrations
- Per-module schema customization

**Common Patterns**:
- Timestamps: createdAt, updatedAt (timestamps: true)
- Soft delete: Optional `isActive` or `status` fields
- Metadata: JSONB/Object fields for extensibility
- Tags: Array fields for categorization

## 4. Service Layer Analysis

### 4.1 Service Layer Coverage

| Module | Service File | CRUD Methods | Business Logic |
|--------|-------------|--------------|----------------|
| threat-intelligence | Multiple services | Full CRUD + enrichment, correlation, archival | ✓ Complex |
| incident-response | Multiple services | Full CRUD + workflow, prioritization, notifications | ✓ Complex |
| vulnerability-management | vulnerabilityService.ts | Full CRUD + scanning | ✓ Moderate |
| ioc-management | iocService.ts | Full CRUD + bulk operations | ✓ Moderate |
| threat-actors | actorService.ts | Full CRUD + campaign tracking | ✓ Moderate |
| siem | siemService.ts | Full CRUD + event ingestion | ✓ Moderate |
| threat-hunting | huntingService.ts | Session management, query execution | ✓ Complex |
| malware-analysis | malwareService.ts | Full CRUD + analysis | ✓ Moderate |
| dark-web | darkwebService.ts | Full CRUD + monitoring | ✓ Moderate |
| threat-feeds | feedService.ts | Full CRUD + feed refresh | ✓ Moderate |
| compliance | complianceService.ts | Full CRUD + gap analysis | ✓ Complex |
| reporting | reportService.ts | Full CRUD + generation | ✓ Moderate |
| collaboration | collaborationService.ts | Full CRUD + messaging | ✓ Moderate |
| automation | playbookService.ts | Full CRUD + execution | ✓ Complex |
| risk-assessment | riskService.ts | Calculation, modeling (no CRUD) | ✓ Complex |
| example-typescript | service.ts | Mock CRUD (reference implementation) | ✓ Simple |

### 4.2 Service Layer Patterns

**TypeScript Service Pattern** (from example-typescript):
```typescript
export class ExampleService {
  public async getData(query: ExampleQuery): Promise<readonly ExampleData[]>
  public getById(id: string): Promise<ExampleData | null>
  public create(input: CreateExampleInput): Promise<ExampleData>
  public async update(id: string, updates: UpdateExampleInput): Promise<ExampleData | null>
  public async delete(id: string): Promise<boolean>
}
```

**Common Service Methods**:
- `create(data)` - Returns created entity
- `list(filters, pagination)` - Returns array with pagination
- `getById(id)` - Returns single entity or null
- `update(id, data)` - Returns updated entity or null
- `delete(id)` - Returns boolean success status

**Business Logic in Services**:
- Data validation (beyond schema validation)
- Business rule enforcement
- Cross-entity operations
- External API integration
- Enrichment and correlation
- Notification triggering

## 5. Data Validation Strategy

### 5.1 Three-Layer Validation

#### Layer 1: Database Model Validation (Sequelize)
- **Location**: `backend/models/*.ts`
- **Mechanism**: TypeScript decorators (@AllowNull, @Unique, @Default)
- **Scope**: Data type constraints, nullability, uniqueness, defaults
- **Example**:
```typescript
@Unique
@AllowNull(false)
@Column(DataType.STRING)
email!: string;
```

#### Layer 2: Request Validation (Joi)
- **Location**: `backend/modules/*/validators/*.ts`
- **Mechanism**: Joi schemas with custom validation rules
- **Scope**: Request structure, field formats, business constraints
- **Example**:
```typescript
export const threatSchema = Joi.object({
  name: Joi.string().required().min(3).max(200),
  type: Joi.string().valid('malware', 'phishing', 'ransomware', 'apt', 'botnet', 'ddos').required(),
  severity: Joi.string().valid('critical', 'high', 'medium', 'low', 'info').required(),
  description: Joi.string().optional(),
});
```

#### Layer 3: Service Layer Business Logic
- **Location**: `backend/modules/*/services/*.ts`
- **Mechanism**: Programmatic validation with error throwing
- **Scope**: Complex business rules, cross-entity validation, state checks
- **Example**:
```typescript
if (!input.name || input.name.trim().length === 0) {
  throw new Error('Name must not be empty');
}
```

### 5.2 Validation Coverage

| Validation Type | PostgreSQL Models | MongoDB Models | API Routes |
|-----------------|------------------|----------------|------------|
| Required fields | ✓ @AllowNull(false) | ✓ required: true | ✓ Joi.required() |
| Data types | ✓ DataType.STRING/INTEGER | ✓ String/Number | ✓ Joi.string()/number() |
| Uniqueness | ✓ @Unique | ✓ unique: true | ✗ (checked at DB) |
| String length | ✗ | ✓ minlength/maxlength | ✓ Joi.min()/max() |
| Enum values | ✗ (application-level) | ✓ enum: [...] | ✓ Joi.valid(...) |
| Format validation | ✗ | ✗ | ✓ Joi.email(), Joi.uri() |
| Custom rules | ✗ | ✓ validate: fn | ✓ Joi.custom() |
| Nested objects | ✗ | ✓ subdocuments | ✓ Joi.object() |
| Array validation | ✓ ARRAY(DataType) | ✓ [Type] | ✓ Joi.array() |

## 6. Special Operations Analysis

### 6.1 Soft Delete vs Hard Delete

**Current Implementation**:

| Model | Deletion Type | Field | Default | Notes |
|-------|---------------|-------|---------|-------|
| User | Soft Delete | isActive | true | Preserves audit trail, can reactivate |
| IOC | Soft Delete | isActive | true | Allows deactivation without data loss |
| Incident | Hard Delete | N/A | N/A | Consider adding soft delete |
| Vulnerability | Hard Delete | N/A | N/A | Consider adding soft delete |
| Asset | Hard Delete | N/A | N/A | Consider adding soft delete |
| ThreatActor | Hard Delete | N/A | N/A | Consider adding soft delete |
| AuditLog | Hard Delete | N/A | N/A | Should NEVER be deleted |

**Recommendation**: Implement soft delete for all models except AuditLog (immutable).

### 6.2 Archive Operations

**Threat Intelligence Archive**:
- **Route**: `POST /api/v1/threat-intelligence/threats/archive`
- **Implementation**: `archivalService.ts`
- **Purpose**: Move old threats to historical storage for performance
- **Pattern**: Status change or separate collection (MongoDB)

**Recommendation**: Standardize archive pattern across modules with configurable retention policies.

### 6.3 Audit Trail Requirements

**Current Audit Implementation**:

| Operation | Audit Model | User Tracking | Timestamp | IP/User-Agent |
|-----------|-------------|---------------|-----------|---------------|
| User actions | AuditLog | ✓ userId FK | ✓ timestamp | ✓ ipAddress, userAgent |
| User changes | User.updatedAt | N/A | ✓ automatic | ✗ |
| Incident changes | Incident.updatedAt | N/A | ✓ automatic | ✗ |
| All other entities | Model.updatedAt | N/A | ✓ automatic | ✗ |

**Gaps**:
- No automatic audit logging for non-user actions
- No change history (old vs new values)
- No deleted record preservation (except soft delete)

**Recommendation**: Implement change tracking middleware or database triggers.

## 7. Missing Database Models

### 7.1 Candidate Models for PostgreSQL Migration

These modules currently use MongoDB but could benefit from PostgreSQL's ACID guarantees:

| Module | Current Storage | Recommended PostgreSQL Model | Rationale |
|--------|----------------|----------------------------|-----------|
| Threat Feeds | MongoDB | ThreatFeed | Relational config data, low write volume |
| Compliance | MongoDB | ComplianceFramework, ComplianceControl | Structured data with relationships |
| Risk Assessment | None | RiskAssessment, RiskModel | Historical risk scores, calculations |
| Playbooks | PlaybookExecution only | Playbook | Playbook definitions need versioning |
| Workflows | MongoDB (IR module) | Workflow | Workflow state machine transitions |

### 7.2 New Model Recommendations

| Model Name | Purpose | Relationships | Key Fields |
|------------|---------|---------------|------------|
| Organization | Multi-tenancy support | HasMany: User, Incident, Asset | name, domain, settings |
| Case | Cross-module case management | HasMany: Incident, Vulnerability | title, status, priority |
| Evidence | Evidence chain of custody | BelongsTo: Incident, Case | type, hash, uploadedBy |
| Tag | Centralized tagging system | ManyToMany: All entities | name, category, color |
| Note | Comments/annotations | BelongsTo: Any entity | content, author, timestamp |
| Attachment | File attachments | BelongsTo: Any entity | filename, path, mimeType |
| Notification | User notification queue | BelongsTo: User | type, message, read status |

---

## 8. Database Performance Considerations

### 8.1 Index Coverage

**Well-Indexed Models**:
- Incident: status, severity, assigned_to_id
- Vulnerability: cve_id, severity, status
- IOC: type, value, severity
- AuditLog: user_id, action, timestamp
- PlaybookExecution: playbook_id, status, started_at

**Missing Indexes** (Recommendations):
- User.organization_id (if multi-tenancy implemented)
- User.lastLogin (for inactive user queries)
- Incident.category (if added)
- Incident.detectedAt (for time-based queries)
- Asset.environment (for filtering)
- ThreatActor.country (for geolocation queries)

### 8.2 Query Optimization Opportunities

**N+1 Query Prevention**:
- Use eager loading with `include` for User → Incidents
- Paginate list queries (currently implemented in routes)
- Implement query result caching for expensive operations

**Partitioning Candidates**:
- AuditLog: Partition by timestamp (monthly/quarterly)
- PlaybookExecution: Partition by started_at
- SIEM events (MongoDB): Time-series collections

### 8.3 Connection Pooling

**Current Configuration** (from `backend/config/database.ts`):
- PostgreSQL: Sequelize connection pool (default: max 5)
- MongoDB: Mongoose connection pool (default: max 100)

**Recommendation**: Tune based on concurrent user load and query patterns.
