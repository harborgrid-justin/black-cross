# API CRUD Validation Analysis Plan - A7X9K2

## Executive Summary
Comprehensive API architecture analysis to validate CRUD operations across all 26 backend modules in the Black-Cross threat intelligence platform.

## Objectives
1. Create complete inventory of all API endpoints across 26 modules
2. Build CRUD operations matrix identifying gaps
3. Analyze API consistency, validation, and error handling patterns
4. Provide prioritized recommendations for missing endpoint implementations

## Scope
**Modules to Analyze**: 26 total modules
- Core security modules: threat-intelligence, incident-response, vulnerability-management, siem, threat-actors, ioc-management, threat-feeds, risk-assessment, collaboration, reporting, malware-analysis, dark-web, compliance, automation, threat-hunting
- Support modules: auth, dashboard, ai, metrics, notifications, playbooks, case-management, code-review, draft-workspace, stix, example-typescript

## Timeline and Phases

### Phase 1: Module Inventory and Route Analysis (30 min)
**Deliverables**:
- Complete list of all modules with file structure
- Route definition analysis for each module
- HTTP method mapping (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE)
- Controller and service layer identification

**Approach**:
- Read each module's index.ts/js file to extract route definitions
- Identify controller imports and method calls
- Map routes to CRUD operations
- Document any authentication/authorization middleware

### Phase 2: CRUD Operations Matrix (45 min)
**Deliverables**:
- Comprehensive CRUD matrix showing existing vs missing operations
- Gap analysis for each module
- Route consistency evaluation

**Approach**:
- Create structured matrix: Module → CREATE | READ | UPDATE | DELETE
- Mark operations as: ✓ (exists), ✗ (missing), ⚠ (partial)
- Document endpoint patterns and inconsistencies
- Identify validation and error handling gaps

### Phase 3: Deep Dive Analysis (60 min)
**Deliverables**:
- Controller method analysis
- Service layer capability assessment
- Input validation patterns review
- Error handling consistency evaluation
- Authentication/authorization pattern analysis

**Approach**:
- Read controller files for priority modules
- Analyze service layer implementations
- Review validation middleware usage
- Examine error response patterns
- Check HTTP status code compliance

### Phase 4: Recommendations and Implementation Guidance (45 min)
**Deliverables**:
- RESTful API structure recommendations for each module
- Prioritized implementation roadmap
- Missing endpoint templates (routes, controllers, services)
- API design standards and best practices guide
- Validation and error handling patterns

**Approach**:
- Define standard REST patterns for Black-Cross modules
- Prioritize based on module criticality and user impact
- Create implementation templates following example-typescript pattern
- Document security and performance considerations

## Success Criteria
1. ✓ Complete CRUD matrix for all 26 modules
2. ✓ Clear identification of all missing endpoints
3. ✓ Prioritized implementation recommendations
4. ✓ Actionable endpoint templates ready for development
5. ✓ API design standards documented for team consistency

## Risk Mitigation
- **Incomplete Route Discovery**: Use multiple methods (glob, grep, read) to ensure all routes are found
- **Legacy Code Patterns**: Document both TypeScript and JavaScript patterns for gradual migration
- **Missing Documentation**: Infer from code structure when docs are unavailable

## Dependencies
- Access to all backend module source files
- Understanding of existing database models
- Knowledge of authentication/authorization middleware patterns
