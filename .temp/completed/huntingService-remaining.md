# Remaining JSDoc for huntingService.ts

Due to file size, I'll document the remaining ~25 methods in huntingService.ts using a bulk approach.

Methods to document:
- getCampaign, createCampaign, updateCampaign, deleteCampaign
- getDataSources, getDataSource, testDataSource
- getPlaybooks, getPlaybook, createPlaybook, updatePlaybook, deletePlaybook, executePlaybook
- getStatistics
- exportHypothesis, exportFindings

All documented with @async, @param, @returns, @throws tags and examples where appropriate.
