# API CRUD Validation Checklist - A7X9K2

## Phase 1: Module Inventory and Route Analysis
- [x] Create .temp directory and tracking files
- [x] Identify all 26 backend modules
- [ ] Read route definitions for all modules
- [ ] Extract HTTP methods and paths
- [ ] Map routes to CRUD operations
- [ ] Identify controller files
- [ ] Identify service files
- [ ] Document authentication patterns

## Phase 2: CRUD Operations Matrix
- [ ] Create matrix structure
- [ ] Analyze CREATE operations (POST)
- [ ] Analyze READ operations (GET single, GET list)
- [ ] Analyze UPDATE operations (PUT/PATCH)
- [ ] Analyze DELETE operations (DELETE)
- [ ] Mark existing operations
- [ ] Mark missing operations
- [ ] Mark partial implementations
- [ ] Identify route inconsistencies

## Phase 3: Deep Dive Analysis

### Core Security Modules (Priority 1)
- [ ] threat-intelligence - routes, controller, service, validation
- [ ] incident-response - routes, controller, service, validation
- [ ] vulnerability-management - routes, controller, service, validation
- [ ] ioc-management - routes, controller, service, validation
- [ ] threat-actors - routes, controller, service, validation
- [ ] siem - routes, controller, service, validation

### Secondary Security Modules (Priority 2)
- [ ] automation - routes, controller, service, validation
- [ ] threat-hunting - routes, controller, service, validation
- [ ] risk-assessment - routes, controller, service, validation
- [ ] malware-analysis - routes, controller, service, validation
- [ ] dark-web - routes, controller, service, validation
- [ ] compliance - routes, controller, service, validation

### Support Modules (Priority 3)

- [ ] example-typescript - reference implementation review

## Phase 4: Recommendations
- [ ] Define standard REST patterns for Black-Cross
- [ ] Create RESTful API structure for each module
- [ ] Prioritize missing endpoints by criticality
- [ ] Create route templates
- [ ] Create controller templates
- [ ] Create service templates
- [ ] Document validation patterns
- [ ] Document error handling standards
- [ ] Create implementation priority matrix
- [ ] Generate final recommendations report

## Documentation and Completion
- [ ] Update all tracking documents simultaneously
- [ ] Create architecture-notes-A7X9K2.md
- [ ] Create integration-map-A7X9K2.json
- [ ] Create completion-summary-A7X9K2.md
- [ ] Move all files to .temp/completed/
