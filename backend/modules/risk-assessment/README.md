### 7. Executive Risk Reporting (9.7)
Executive-level risk reporting and dashboards.

**Capabilities:**
- Executive summary generation
- KRI (Key Risk Indicators) tracking
- Risk appetite alignment
- Board-ready reports
- Risk heat maps
- Trend summaries
- Comparison to peer organizations
- Action recommendations

**Endpoints:**
- `GET /api/v1/risk/reports/executive` - Get executive report
- `POST /api/v1/risk/reports/generate` - Generate custom report

## Data Models

### RiskAssessment
Core risk assessment model with likelihood, impact, risk scores, controls, and mitigation plans.

### AssetCriticality
Asset criticality evaluation with business impact dimensions and tier classification.

### RiskModel
Custom risk scoring models with configurable formulas, matrices, and factors.

### ThreatImpact
Multi-dimensional threat impact analysis with financial, operational, reputational, and regulatory dimensions.

## Risk Calculation Formulas

- **Basic**: Risk = Likelihood × Impact
- **Advanced**: Risk = (Likelihood × Impact) / Control Effectiveness
- **Quantitative**: Risk = Asset Value × Threat Probability × Vulnerability Exploitability
- **Custom**: User-defined formulas via Risk Models
