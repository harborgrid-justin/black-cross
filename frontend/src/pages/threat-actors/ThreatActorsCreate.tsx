 * - Attribution and sophistication level
 * - Motivation and target sectors
 * - TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures)
 * - Known campaigns and operations
 * - Associated indicators of compromise (IOCs)
 *
 * Navigation:

 *
 * @module pages/threat-actors/ThreatActorsCreate
 * @requires react-router-dom - For navigation between pages
 * @requires @mui/material - Material-UI components
