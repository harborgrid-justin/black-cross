/**
 * Dark Web creation page component.
 *
 * Provides a form interface for creating new dark web monitoring entries. This component
 * handles user input for discovering and tracking potential security threats found on
 * dark web sources including forums, marketplaces, and paste sites.
 *
 * @component
 *
 * @returns {JSX.Element} The rendered dark web creation page with form and navigation
 *
 * @remarks
 * This is currently a placeholder implementation. Future enhancements should include:
 * - Form fields for finding type, severity, source, description
 * - Validation for required fields
 * - Integration with darkWebService for API calls
 * - Error handling and success notifications
 * - Support for attaching evidence and metadata
 *
 * @security
 * - This page should only be accessible to authenticated users with appropriate permissions
 * - Input validation is critical as this deals with potentially malicious content
 * - Sensitive dark web findings should be properly classified and access-controlled
 *
 * @example
 * ```tsx
 * // Used in routing configuration
 * <Route path="/dark-web/create" element={<DarkWebCreate />} />
 * ```
 *
 * @see {@link DarkWebMain} for the main dark web dashboard
 * @see {@link DarkWebEdit} for editing existing entries
